Description: The Subsemble algorithm is a general subset ensemble prediction method, which can be used for small, moderate, or large datasets. Subsemble partitions the full dataset into subsets of observations, fits a specified underlying algorithm on each subset, and uses a unique form of k-fold cross-validation to output a prediction function that combines the subset-specific fits. An oracle result provides a theoretical performance guarantee for Subsemble. The paper, "Subsemble: An ensemble method for combining subset-specific algorithm fits" is authored by Stephanie Sapp, Mark J. van der Laan & John Canny (2014) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2013.864263>.
